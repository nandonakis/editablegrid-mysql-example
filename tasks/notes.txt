It was a mistake to make the profile samples named 'postgres' and 'mysql'. These are dbtypes, this solution can handle infinite profiles, where each profile has an associated dbtype.
I've updated the solution to handle profiles in this way, please check.


1) where there is no value, add row should add "DEFAULT' rather than null  (done)
2) add new row should pull the default value from the meta and place that in the row inserted and the html table.

3) add new row is doing that multiple thing again.
i.e. click add new a couple of times, it goes exponential?

4) can you make booleans default to rendering a checkbox?

5) in addition to checking in the backend, can you use the max_length for text strings to set the maxsize of the text input field?
