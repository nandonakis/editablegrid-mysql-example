I've merged pdo branch to master

I rewrote debug. It gives an Notice: array to string conversion error message. Please fix first and push.
Duplicate and insert don't work

I don't understand why tablename vs table.
Can we standardise on table?

git rename pdodb.php to db.php
i think db.php should be pure db operations
backend.php should be clean like it is
A lot of these new functions should be moved into db_utils.php, perhaps with another name.

look at the way I implemented db.php::delete
db.php should be a pure db.php library, not have access to POST.

query:
for an execute function:
	 should return number of rows affected (including zero) and undef for error (e.g. invalid sql)
for a select function:
	should return a resultset (array of arrays) on success, and undefined for error.

Rewrite the other CRUD operations simililarly.
backend:add should go straight to db:insert

If there is a PHP error in backend.php, it fails badly in the frontend.
Can backend.js handle it properly if it doesn't receive pure json (or 'ok') back from backend.php

when it doesn't have a value, insert was trying to insert '' i think, which is invalid for timestamp or whatever.
the add function should probably create an insert with just the id with 'default'/next_id, the other fields should not be in the insert command.
